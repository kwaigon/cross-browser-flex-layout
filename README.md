# Cross Browser Flex Layout

This is CSS-only cross browser solution for using so called "flex-layout". It includes compiled css (just to drop in your project), as well as SASS which can be changed and re-compiled.

##Why?

Browsers (still) render things differently and some properties still have to be used with browser prefixes. This takes care of all that leaving you with simple and elegent way to quickly make complex application layouts in a browser, not worrying about compatibility. Maximum compatibility has been ensured.

However, only IE10 and up, and prefereably latest (but not limited to latest) Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, as well as MOBILE browsers.

##Demo?

Supporting site with some demos can be found here: [Cross Browser Flex Layout](http://flex.illusiana.net)

##Usage

Just drop compiled layout.css file from layout folder and you are good to go. More on how to use classes please refer to supporting website.
